## Dr. Sarah Chen

Let me analyze this systematically. Our SaaS platform has 30% monthly churn appears to be a complex challenge that requires understanding the underlying system dynamics. 

I would approach this by:

• **Identifying key components** - What are the main elements involved?
• **Mapping relationships** - How do these components interact?
• **Finding leverage points** - Where can we intervene most effectively?

Could you provide more context about the specific constraints or goals you&#39;re working with?
