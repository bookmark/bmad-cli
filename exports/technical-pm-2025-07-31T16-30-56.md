What is technical debt and how should product managers handle it?

## technical-pm

Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. Technical debt is often the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. It can accumulate for various reasons, such as outdated codebases, the adoption of new technologies, or changes in business requirements. While technical debt is not inherently bad and can be a strategic choice, if not managed properly, it can lead to increased maintenance costs, decreased productivity, and can impede the ability to introduce new features or adapt to changing needs.

As a Senior Technical Product Manager, my approach to managing technical debt involves several key strategies:

• **Acknowledge and Track Technical Debt**: The first step is recognizing that technical debt exists and understanding its sources. This can be done by creating a backlog of technical debt items, similar to product backlog items, but focused on technical improvements.


• **Evaluate and Prioritize**: Not all technical debt is created equal. Some debt may have a more immediate impact on product performance or scalability, while other debt might be less critical. Prioritizing technical debt involves assessing its impact on the business, the product, and the development team&#39;s efficiency.


• **Incorporate into Planning**: Product managers should work closely with the engineering team to incorporate technical debt reduction efforts into the regular planning cycles. This might mean allocating a certain percentage of each development sprint to addressing technical debt or scheduling dedicated sprints focused solely on reducing technical debt.


• **Make Informed Trade-offs**: Decisions to incur technical debt should be made strategically, understanding the trade-offs between speed and long-term sustainability. When choosing to take on technical debt, it should be done with a plan for eventual repayment.


• **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Transparency about technical debt and its impacts is crucial. Product managers should communicate with both internal stakeholders (like engineers and executives) and external stakeholders (such as customers, if applicable) about the reasons for incurring technical debt, plans for addressing it, and the expected benefits of doing so.


• **Monitor and Adapt**: Managing technical debt is an ongoing process. Regularly reviewing and reassessing the technical debt backlog is necessary to adapt to changing circumstances and ensure that the team is always working on the most impactful tasks.



In summary, as product managers, handling technical debt requires a balance between short-term gains and long-term product health. It involves strategic decision-making, continuous prioritization, and collaboration with engineering teams to ensure that technical debt is managed in a way that supports the overall goals and sustainability of the product.
