## product-lead

Hello! I&#39;m product-lead, your Specialist. How can I help you today?

## You

Dr. Sarah Chen: Let me analyze this systematically. Our SaaS platform has 30% monthly churn appears to be a complex challenge that requires understanding the underlying system dynamics. 

I would approach this by:
1. **Identifying key components** - What are the main elements involved?
2. **Mapping relationships** - How do these components interact?
3. **Finding leverage points** - Where can we intervene most effectively?

Could you provide more context about the specific constraints or goals you're working with?
